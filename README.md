# LoanCalculator-using-javascript


So this project is a loan calculator.

This is something that an actual accountant could use to quickly show their clients how long it would

take to pay a loan back how much interest would be how much the total amount would be and so on.

Formula used to calculate monthly payment,toatl payment is (PV=PMTi[1âˆ’1(1+i)n]).
Here PV is the loan amount, PMT is the monthly payment, i is the interest rate per month in decimal form (interest rate percentage divided by 12), n is the number of months (term of the loan in months).
Further Advancements Coming Soon!
