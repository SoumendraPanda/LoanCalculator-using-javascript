# LoanCalculator-using-javascript


So this project is a loan calculator.

This is something that an actual accountant could use to quickly show their clients how long it would

take to pay a loan back how much interest would be how much the total amount would be and so on.

Formula used to calculate monthly payment,toatl payment is
(PV=PMTi[1−1(1+i)n])
Here
PV is the loan amount
PMT is the monthly payment
i is the interest rate per month in decimal form (interest rate percentage divided by 12)
n is the number of months (term of the loan in months)
